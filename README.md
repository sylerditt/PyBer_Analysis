# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to visualize rideshare data and determine average fare by city type (rural, urban, and suburban). This will allow us to find out how much underserved neighborhoods have to pay for rides in their area. 

## Results
### The differences between the ride-sharing data based on city type include the following: 

1. Urban cities had the most expensive fares followed by suburban followed by rural
2. Drivers follow similar patterns with the most in urban cities and least in rural
3. Average fare per driver follows a different pattern with rural drivers making the most and urban drivers making the least

## Summary
#### One idea to address disparities among city types is offering incentives for drivers in the urban areas to drive out to more rural areas to help lower prices for riders and get drivers paid more. For example, surge prices could be offered when more rides are being requested in rural areas. Maps could also be provided showing where drivers are needed, allowing willing drivers to head to the area where more riders need them if there are enough urban or suburban drivers. Another idea is increasing prices for urban riders if it is busy, causing them to look for alternative transportation and allow drivers to head to rural areas where they are needed more, or make more money if they choose to stay.
